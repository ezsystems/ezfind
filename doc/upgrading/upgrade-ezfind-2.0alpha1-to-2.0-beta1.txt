Upgrade instructions
====================

1) re-indexing may be needed as schema.xml has changed
-------------------------------------------------------

Because "integer" types was declared in schema.xml until alpha1,
but "int" used in the code, the schema has been adapted to reflect this.

Because of the schema change, re-indexing your site is required if you declared 
some datatypes as being "integer", it should be "int" instead
