eZ find & Solr multicore how-to
===============================

Since eZ Find 5.3 (which uogrades Solr to 4.7), running Solr in multicore mode
is the default

Starting solr multicore
=======================


To start it, use the regular command line
    $java/: java -jar start.jar

Since eZ Find 5.3, the directory solr.multicore does not exist anymore!

Configuring solr additional cores
=================================

You will find in extension/ezfind/java a folder named solr.languages. This
directory contains language specific schema configurations.


solr.xml
--------


The <cores> element is used to configure the administration URL for the cores,
as well as the list of available cores. Each 'core' sub-element configures a
new core. The 'name' attribute determines what URL element is used to access
this core, while the instanceDir attribute determines the subfolder of
solr where this core configuration can be found.

Creating a new core
-------------------
Note that even though only language specific cores are used by eZ find at the
moment, cores can be used for much more than that.

1) you need to create a new directory under java/solr and then copy the default
configuration, extension/ezfind/java/solr/ezp-default/conf to this new
directory, typically the target locale name::

    $ cd extension/ezfind/java/solr
    $ mkdir <new-core>
    $ cp -rp ezp-default/conf <new-core>

Finally you should copy the appropriate files from
extension/ezfind/java/solr.languages

For example, for a  french language core:

    $ cp ../solr.languages/fr/* <new-core>/conf

2) Make sure Solr knows about the new core

This can be done in two ways: edit the solr.xml file manually

2a) edit solr/solr.xml and add the newly created core here::

    <core name="<new-core>" instanceDir="<new-core>" />

  Then restart Solr

2b) go the the Solr admin interface

Select the "Core Admin"
Click "Add new core" and fill in the directory and name of the new core

You do not need to restart Solr, the core is added and ready to use


Tips
====
To access the solr backoffice, you must use the URI specified in solr.xml::
    http://localhost:8983/solr/admin/cores

This will give you an overview of the solr configuration, as well as a direct
access to each core's admin.
